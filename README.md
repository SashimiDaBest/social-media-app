## Documentation

A detailed description of each class. This should include the functionality included in the class, the testing done to verify it works properly, and its relationship to other classes in the project. 

- Chat class and Interface: The Chat Class and interface store the message history between two or more users. Each Chat contains identifying information and an ArrayList of the Messages in that chat, with each Message including the author and message type. When a new Chat is created, it is automatically given a unique file that specifies its ID, the IDs of the users involved in the chat, and its detailed message history. This file can be read from using another constructor to instantiate a Chat object, allowing Chats to persist across instances of the project.
